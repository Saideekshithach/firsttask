    <dd style="font-size: large;" align="justify">The success of the Indian Independence movement helped India achieve independence from British rule on August 15, 1947. The Indian Independence Act of 1947 and an act of the United Kingdom's Parliament led to the partitioning of British India into two new independent dominions of the British Commonwealth. 
        As a result, India became a democratic monarchy led by George VI acting as head of the state and Earl Mountbatten as the governor-general. 
        However, no permanent constitution was formed, but the laws were adopted from a modified version of the Government of India Act of 1935. 
        On August 29, 1947, a resolution was passed to appoint a drafting community to draft a permanent constitution. Dr. B.R Ambedkar was the chairman of this committee and a draft was prepared and submitted to the Constituent Assembly on November 4, 1947.
        The Assembly met for 166 days over two years before confirming the final version of the constitution. On January 24, 1950, after several deliberations and modifications, both Hindi and English handwritten versions of the constitution were signed by 308 members of the Assembly.
        India's Independence Day marks the end of British Rule, while Republic Day commemorates the enactment of the constitution. Dr. Rajendra Prasad inaugurated his first term as the President of the Indian Union on this significant day.
        As per the transitional provisions outlined in the new Constitution, the Constituent Assembly seamlessly transformed into the Parliament of India.</dd>

    <dd style="font-size: large;" align="justify">European traders had established outposts in the Indian subcontinent by the late 17th century. Through overwhelming military strength, the East India Company fought and annexed local kingdoms and established themselves as the dominant force by the 18th century. Following the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the Government of India Act 1858 led the British Crown to assume direct control of India. In the decades following, civic society gradually emerged across India, most notably the Indian National Congress Party, formed in 1885.[7][1]: 123  The period after World War I was marked by colonial reforms such as the Montagu–Chelmsford Reforms, but it also witnessed the enactment of the unpopular Rowlatt Act and calls for self-rule by Indian activists. The discontent of this period crystallised into nationwide non-violent movements of non-cooperation and civil disobedience, led by Mahatma Gandhi</dd>

    <dd style="font-size: large;" align="justify">Millions of Muslim, Sikh and Hindu refugees trekked the newly drawn borders in the months surrounding independence.In Punjab, where the borders divided the Sikh regions in halves, massive bloodshed followed; in Bengal and Bihar, where Mahatma Gandhi's presence assuaged communal tempers, the violence was mitigated. In all, between 250,000 and 1,000,000 people on both sides of the new borders died in the violence.While the entire nation was celebrating the Independence Day, Gandhi stayed in Calcutta in an attempt to stem the carnage.On 14 August 1947, the Independence Day of Pakistan, the new Dominion of Pakistan came into being; Muhammad Ali Jinnah was sworn in as its first Governor General in Karachi. The Constituent Assembly of India met for its fifth session at 11 pm on 14 August in the Constitution Hall in New Delhi.The session was chaired by the president Rajendra Prasad. In this session, Jawaharlal Nehru delivered the Tryst with Destiny speech proclaiming India's independence.</br>Long years ago we made a tryst with destiny, and now the time comes when we shall redeem our pledge, not wholly or in full measure, but very substantially. At the stroke of the midnight hour, when the world sleeps, India will awake to life and freedom. A moment comes, which comes but rarely in history when we step out from the old to the new when an age ends, and when the soul of a nation, long suppressed, finds utterance. It is fitting that at this solemn moment, we take the pledge of dedication to the service of India and her people and to the still larger cause of humanity.Tryst with Destiny speech, Jawaharlal Nehru, 15 August 1947.The members of the Assembly formally took the pledge of being in the service of the country. A group of women, representing the women of India, formally presented the national flag to the assembly.</br>The Dominion of India became an independent country as official ceremonies took place in New Delhi. Nehru assumed office as the first prime minister, and the viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, continued as its first governor general.Gandhi's name was invoked by crowds celebrating the occasion; Gandhi himself however took no part in the official events. Instead, he marked the day with a 24-hour fast, during which he spoke to a crowd in Calcutta, encouraging peace between Hindus and Muslims.</dd>
